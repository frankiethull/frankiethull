Welcome to my personal github account! Most of my repos are in the realm of binding languages, extending libraries, bridging tools, making color schemes, or collecting data. I like to tinker with data visualizations, shaders, fluid dynamics, deep learning algorithms, LLMs; & get to extend my knowledge of packaging, S3/S4/S7, qmd/rmd design, & more in the process. Most importantly, love the idea of collaborating with others & open-source software. Please submit an issue or PR if interested in contributing to one of my experimental libraries.  

libraries I'm *actively* working on: 
- :corn: {maize} a binding of specialty kernels for SVMs to {parsnip}
- :llama: {kuzco} an LLM image assistant for classification, sentiment, and detection  
- :watch: {kantime} kolmogorov-arnold networks for time series in R via Nixtla & {modeltime}
- :bar_chart: {ggpal2} an AI {pal} assistant for data visualization

  
Currently, hold the title of DS&A Director and lead a team working on ML in energy. Live in Colorado and most of my free time is spent with loving wife, two beautiful boys, one energetic dog, & two grumpy cats.
